# I2C Communication interface

The I2C interface consists of 2 pins:

+ SCL, also known as the clock pin.
+ SDA, also known as the data pin.

With these two connections, and a power supply, it is possible to get data from a variety of sensors measuring
physical parameters.

## I2C function calls


=== "p.I2C.Scan()"
	```python
	def I2CScan()
	scan the I2C bus, and return a list of addresses that responded
	
	  return: list of numbers between 0-127.
	
	```

=== "p.I2C.writeBulk()"
	```python
	def I2CWriteBulk(address,bytestream)
	write a set of bytes to an I2C address
	
	  address: Address of I2C slave device. 0-127
	  bytestream: list of bytes to write
	  return: True if success.
	
	```

=== "p.I2C.readBulk()"
	```python
	def I2CReadBulk(address,register,total_bytes)
	write a set of bytes to an I2C address
	
	  address: Address of I2C slave device. 0-127
	  register: The starting address in the I2C slave device from where bytes are to be read
	  total_bytes: Total number of bytes to read
	  return: bytes, timeout
	  "ignore contents if timeout==True"
	
	```

## Luminosity sensor(TSL2561) Example

A light sensor is being monitored with the flash of the camera enabled. As the camera approaches the sensor, the readings go up. Not a very clever example. TODO.

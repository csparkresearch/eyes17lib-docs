## ADS1115 16 bit ADC

The I2C interface consists of 2 pins:

+ SCL, also known as the clock pin.
+ SDA, also known as the data pin.

connect these two to SCL and SDA pins of the SEELab/ExpEYES device, and connect 5V and GND also.

### Minimal functional code

Read Data Unipolar from ADS0 input pin

=== "Using the ADS115 class"
	!!! tip ""
		```python
		from eyes17 import eyes
		from eyes17.SENSORS import ADS1115
		p = eyes.open()
		adc = ADS1115(p.I2C)
		print(adc.readADC_SingleEnded(0),' volts')	
		```

=== "Using the get_sensor function"
	!!! tip ""
		```python
		from eyes17 import eyes
		p = eyes.open()
		adc = .pget_sensor('ADS1115')
		print(adc.read()[0],' volts')	
		```
